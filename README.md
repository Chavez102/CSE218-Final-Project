# CSE218- Historic Stock For Amazon and Tesla
In this project, I use javafx to build a desktop app that allows the user to search through 20 years of daily Amazon or tesla stock data.

## CSE218- Technologies Used:
From a public API, I was able to extract data (in json format) into a HashMap. Using the hashmap I am able to find any stock's information and display them to the user. With Scene builder, javaFx is done quite quickly.
